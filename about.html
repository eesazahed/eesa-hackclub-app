        <p>hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>
          i'm eesa. i'm 16 years old and i've been coding for a really long
          time. since i was like 8 i think, maybe younger, and scratch was my
          first coding language. i don't have an account though, because i used
          the offline editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          anyways, soon after, i started to learn python. i remember that i
          would feel really smart whenever i'd copy the tutorials and there
          wouldn't be any errors when i ran the program. i still feel the same
          way today when i copy tutorials. enough about that though.
        </p>
        <p>
          i got bored of python at one point and tried learning html. i remember
          being like 10 years old and making goofy "portfolio" websites with
          terrible css, but hey, let's be real, we've all been there at one
          point. my "portfolio" consisted of some of my other html projects.
          projects like "all about lego" and "super mario website" and stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          i got better with html and css over time through practice. my next
          goal was to learn javascript. i got some library books and began
          adding js to my sites. i remember how awesome it felt to finally
          understand how to handle forms, buttons, and inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          i started to learn react, and the syntax took a while to get used to
          at first. later on, i began to learn the "mern" stack. this is around
          when i started to learn typescript and tailwind as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          once i was out of "tutorial hell" i decided to work on a hobby
          project:
          <a
            href="https://laser.vercel.app/feed"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >lasersocial</a
          >
          - a fully functioning social media platform. i tell people that i
          built it to practice my full stack development skills, but at the
          time, my reason for making it was because my parents didn't allow me
          to use social media. i got a few of my friends to join but they really
          only used it for a few days.
        </p>

        <p>
          when i entered high school, i kind of "lost interest" in coding for a
          while and dedicated more of my time towards some of my other
          <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a>. however, during the summer of 2024, i
          received an email from github's newsletter about
          <a
            href="https://hackclub.com/arcade/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >hack club arcade</a
          >. i spent a lot of my summer working on some projects for arcade, and
          i've been (somewhat) active in the hack club community ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
          i code quite a lot nowadays (writing this in may 2025), check out my
          <a
            href="https://github.com/eesazahed"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >github</a
          >
          and see what i'm working on. i'm gonna be honest, i should really be
          spending more of my time prepping for college applications.

        <p>coding is not my only interest</p>
        <p>
          i like to play sports. specifically, basketball and muay thai. i don't
          play on a team or anything, i just play for fun. i've also recently
          started learning how to do tricks on a skateboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          i used to play video games a lot, but nowadays i don't really have the
          time. when i do, it's either minecraft, civ 6, or mario kart 8 deluxe.
        </p>
        <p>
          i really like both attack on titan and avatar the last airbender. if
          you're into any of those as well, feel free to yap about it with me.
