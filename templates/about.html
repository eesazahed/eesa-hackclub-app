  <p>hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>
    i'm eesa. i'm 16 years old, and i've been coding for a really long time. i
    was around 8 years old when i began to learn scratch, my first coding
    language. i don't have an account though, because i used the offline editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    later, i started to learn python from some books i borrowed from the
    library. i remember feeling really smart whenever i copied the tutorials
    from the book and ran them on my computer without any errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    over the years, i built things with html, css, javascript, the "mern" stack,
    and more. once i was out of "tutorial hell," i decided to work on a hobby
    project:
    <a
      href="https://laser.vercel.app/feed"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >lasersocial</a
    >
    - a fully functioning social media platform. i got a few of my friends to
    join, but they really only used it for a few days.
  </p>

  <p>
    when i entered high school, i kind of "lost interest" in coding for a while
    and dedicated more of my time to some of my other
    <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a>. however, during the summer of 2024, i
    received an email from github's newsletter about
    <a
      href="https://hackclub.com/arcade/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >hack club arcade</a
    >. i spent a lot of my summer working on various projects for arcade, and
    i've been (somewhat) active in the hack club community ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    i code quite a lot nowadays (writing this in may 2025), check out my
    <a

      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >github</a
    >
    and see what i'm working on. i'm gonna be honest, i should really be
    spending more of my time prepping for college applications.
  </p>

  <p>coding isn't my only passion</p>
  <p>
    i like to play sports. specifically, basketball and muay thai. i don't play
    on a team or anything, just play for fun. i've also recently started to
    learn how to do tricks on a skateboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    i used to play video games a lot, but nowadays i don't really have the time.
    when i do, it's either minecraft, civ 6, or mario kart 8 deluxe.
  </p>
  <p>
    i really like attack on titan and avatar the last airbender. if you're into
    any of those as well, feel free to yap about it with me.
