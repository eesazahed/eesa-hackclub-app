  <p>hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>
    i'm eesa. i'm 16 years old, and i've been coding for a really long time. i
    was around 8 years old when i began learning scratch, before trying to learn
    python using books i borrowed from the library.
  </p>
  <p>
    over the years, i built things with html, css, javascript, the "mern" stack,
    and more. once i was out of "tutorial hell," i decided to work on a hobby
    project:

    - a fully functioning social media platform. i got a few of my friends to
    join, but they really only used it for a few days.
  </p>
  <p>
    i code quite a lot nowadays (writing this in july 2025), check out my

    and see what i'm working on. i'm gonna be honest, i should really be
    spending more of my time prepping for college applications.

  <p>coding isn't my only passion.</p>
  <p>
    i like to play sports. specifically, basketball and muay thai. i don't play
    on a team or anything, just play for fun. i've also recently started to
    learn how to do tricks on a skateboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    i used to play video games a lot, but nowadays i don't really have the time.
    when i do, it's either minecraft, civ 6, or mario kart 8 deluxe.
  </p>
  <p>
    i really like
